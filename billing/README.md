# Billing

## Overview

This product was born from a requirement to enable executive reporting for Azure Billing in terms leaders should understand

The target scope of the output is to obtain Price (P) and Quantity (Q) by org unit/functional area/product. Many other views are possible!

The output is in the form of a resource group level aggregate CSV that can be turned into Pivot tables as required

## Why is this program needed?

Unfortunately MS really dont make it easy with regards their billing csv format or to enable enterprise reporting

Our monthly billing CSV is 6GB+ so excel based reporting isnt possible.

UnitOfMeasure in the billing CSV is particularly useless, so we have to go to the effort of downloading from the Azure Prices API, described at the end of the readme.

Quantity in the billing CSV is some devious value that at the day level does not reflect the actual real world quantity; it does make sense when you aggregate across the month

When put together the failings of UnitOfMeasure and Quantity are large enough to justify this program

## How To

### 1. Customise the lookup CSVs

#### managedDisks.csv

The lookup for managed disk names providing the SizeGB. Note There is a challenge with "performance-enabled" managed disks, which will report the size of the underlying disk rather than the available volume

#### platformMap.csv

Provides a method to map your business to subscriptions/resource groups

Copy *platformMap_example.csv* to create your own as ours has been .gitignored

There are three levels available

- TopPlatform, e.g org, portfolio
- Platform, e.g. functional area, platform
- ProductCode, e.g. product, application

#### reportingCategories.csv

Maps azure products to reporting categories

#### summaryCategories.csv

Summarises reporting categories for executive reporting

#### vmSizes.csv

Lookup for VM names to CPU and MemGB


### 2. Create the config file

Copy config.example.json and edit the values as required

- workingDirectory: directory where the billing file is found and where output gets created
- azurePricesCSVFile: name of the billing file
- NumDaysInMonth: how many days in the month
- billingCSVMaxDate: max date of the billing file (used in Azure Price API generation)
- outputAzurePricesCSVFile - name of the generated azure prices lookup
- outputAggregateRGCSVFile - name of the main output file, the one you want
- lookup directory, where the supplied/customised lookups are located

Example:

```json
{
"workingDirectory": "/mnt/c/Users/nnn/Downloads/",
"billingCSVFile": "ActualCostMtD_174c3ad5-7777-4e8d-824d-52f47a1f84dd.csv",
"azurePricesCSVFile": "azurePrices.csv",
"billingCSVMaxDate": "31/01/2021",
"NumDaysInMonth": "31",
"lookupDirectory": "./lookups/",
"outputAzurePricesCSVFile": "azurePrices.csv",
"outputAggregateRGCSVFile": "aggregateRG.csv"
}
```

### 3. Clone and run the code

With core i7 and SSD you can expect ~3.5mins per 1 million records

```bash
go run cmd/main.go azure billing -c ./config.json
```

### 4. Create reports from the output

Create pivot tables from the data in whatever fashion you prefer. Below are a couple of sample executive views:

### Price

- Filter: Portfolio, Platform, ProductName
- Rows: ReportingCategory, ReportingSubCategory
- Columns: SummaryCategory
- Values: Sum of summaryQuantity

### Quantity

- Filter: Portfolio, Platform, ProductName
- Rows: ReportingCategory, ReportingSubCategory
- Columns: SummaryCategory
- Values: Sum of CostInBillingCurrency

## Azure Pricing API

The code makes use of the public Azure Pricing API to get a useful Unit Of Measure

The first time you invoke azureBilling product it will scrape the API and write a file called azureBilling.csv (see config.json)

For the docs, see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cost-management/retail-prices/azure-retail-prices

### Example api return value

## Other Notes

Some issues were experienced where xls created categories were not matching, which turned out to be the difference between space types
This may bite you during usage, so providing info below

$ echo "  " | od -An -vtu1
194 160 <-- non breaking space (\& nbsp;)
32 <-- actual space!

One way to match in vs code:

Ctrl + F => ([\u00A0\u00C2]) (remember to click the .* button to enable Regex)
